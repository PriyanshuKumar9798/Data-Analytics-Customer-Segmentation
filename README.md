# Data Analytics Customer Segmentation

## Goal of the project
The purpose of this project is to conduct a Customer Segmentation Analysis for an Automobile bike Company. Customer segmentation is performed by developing a RFM Model. RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a behavior-based approach grouping customers into segments. It groups the customers on the basis of their previous purchase transactions. In this analysis the customer segment was divided into 11 groups. The analysis will help in determining which customers segments should be targeted in order to enhance sales revenue for the company. 

## Analysis Approach
### 1. Data Quality Assessment and Data Cleaning
The first step towards generating useful insights from the data was the data preparation, quality assessment and data cleaning step. After the cleaning process exploratory data analysis on the dataset and identification customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights can be performed.
